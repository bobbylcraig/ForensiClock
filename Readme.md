## Nifty React App

ForensiClock is a quick React App that allows users to use their phone to time competitors at a Speech & Debate competition without the experience being distracting or intrusive to the round.

## Outline

- Enter app. Receive two options...you can choose judge or practice.
- If judge:
    - User will be notified that all sounds and vibration, as well as notifications, will be blocked by the app. Furthermore, the app will prevent the screen from sleeping.
    - User will then be prompted to select a category (e.g. OO, DUO, PF, LD, etc) and the appropriate time ranges will be set automatically (there may also be a custom time range)
    - The user will be able to select start/stop times, competitors times will be stored upon pressing a button, and notifications at usual hand signal periods will be given to aid the judge (5 yellow flashes or something similar) but not distract the speaker
- If practice:
    - Ask user for preferred notification method:
        - If vibrate, speaker puts phone in pocket to be notified of time periods (either intervals or period of time remaining)
        - If sound, speaker can do whatever they want. Notifications, again, will come in form of intervals or period of time remaining.

### Goals

- Customizable interface
- Portrait and landscape abilities
- Finish quickly
- Maybe generate ad revenue (although I _do_ hate ads...)
